# Cram

Cram is a fake web service handler for integration testing.

You need Cram if you have a site that makes calls to web services with a client that you can't mock or stub out, eg. something that isn't able to be tested with Rack::Test.

(Cram currently sees use with Cucumber and Capybara, testing a legacy PHP app.)


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'cram'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cram


## Usage

TODO: Needs fleshing out.

```
service = Cram::Service.new 'http://localhost:9999'
service.respond_to 'GET', '/products', :with => {
  :content_type => :json
  :status => 200,
  :body => [
    {:id => 1, :title => "Big Shoe"},
    {:id => 2, :title => "Little Shoe"}
  ].to_json
}
```

```
service  = Cram::Service.new 'http://orders.10.0.0.95.xip.io:9999'
response = service.create_response(
  :content_type => :json
  :status => 200
)

service.respond_to 'GET',  '/orders',   :with => response.with(:body => '[]')
service.respond_to 'POST', '/orders',   :with => response.with(:body => '{"id": 1}')
service.respond_to 'GET',  '/orders/2', :with => response.with(:status => 404)
```
